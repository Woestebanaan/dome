# Experiments with dome projection in WebGL


## Getting started

To download all prerequisites with npm run, this only needs to be done once
after checking out the repository

``` shell
npm install
```

To build the project in a single run, execute

``` shell
npm run build
```

This should result in a `dist/index.html` that can be opened in the browser.
All other dependencies such as bundled javascript files and style sheets should
also be in `dist/`.

To immediately compile this project while developing, updating the output files
in `dist`, start the webpack dev server, which should open a browser windows

``` shell
npm start
```
